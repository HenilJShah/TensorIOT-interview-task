Develop a `ParkingLot` class that calculates parking spots based on square footage, accommodating different spot sizes. Create a `Car` class with methods for displaying the license plate and parking in the lot. Program cars to park in random spots, handling spot occupancy dynamically. Optionally, map the lot's state to a JSON file and upload to S3.
